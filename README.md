# 9Line

The repository for the game 9 Line, is currently under heavy development.

9 Line is a hardcore cooperative shooter that puts you in the boots of a rescue operator, where every piece of gear, medical gauze, and second counts. Take on contracts and equip yourself to operate in a hostile, pixelated, post-apocalyptic landscape. Set up camp, sustain yourself in the AO, and attempt to get a good radio signal-but above all, make it out alive.
